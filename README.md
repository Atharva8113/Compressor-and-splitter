# Nagarkot Compressor

A professional utility for specialized PDF compression and splitting, optimized for internal Nagarkot document workflows.

## Quick Start

*   **Requirements:** Windows OS.
*   **Installation:** Simply download the `Nagarkot Compressor.exe` file. It is a standalone application; no installation or extra files are required.

## How to Use (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Open the App:** Double-click `Nagarkot Compressor.exe` to launch.
2.  **Select Documents:** Click the **Select PDFs** button to load one or more PDF files you need to process.
3.  **Set Destination:** Click the browse button `...` next to "Output Folder" to choose where the finished files will be saved.
4.  **Choose Action:**
    *   **Split Only:** Breaks large PDFs into smaller parts (default is 1.9 MB chunks).
    *   **Compress Only:** Reduces the file size without splitting.
    *   **Compress + Split:** First compresses the file, then splits it if it is still too large.
5.  **Start:** Click the blue **Generate/Run** button. The "Status" column will update to "Done" when finished.

## Common Issues

*   **File In Use error:** Ensure the PDF files are not currently open in Adobe Acrobat or your browser before processing.
